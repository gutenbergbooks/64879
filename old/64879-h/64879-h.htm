<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">2 <span
class="smcap">Samuel</span> xxiv. 10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And David&rsquo;s heart smote him after that he had
numbered the people</i>.&nbsp; <i>And David said unto the
Lord</i>, <i>I have sinned greatly in that I have done</i>:
<i>and now</i>, <i>I beseech thee</i>, <i>O Lord</i>, <i>take
away the iniquity of thy servant</i>; <i>for I have done very
foolishly</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time here spoken of, David
had been, for nearly forty years, king over &ldquo;<i>the
Lord&rsquo;s people</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The youngest of eight sons
of one of the shepherds of Israel, and raised from that lowly
station to the throne by the express appointment of Jehovah, it
may well excite our surprise to observe his conduct on the
occasion to which the text refers.&nbsp; We might have supposed
that the incidents of his early life, no less than the experience
of his riper years, would have taught him a more simple spirit of
faith and trust than that which he now showed.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>A
lion and a bear</i>&rdquo; came upon him while he was yet a boy,
and took a lamb out of his father&rsquo;s flock which he was
keeping; and he was not only delivered from them, but enabled
alone and unharmed to slay them. <a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a>&nbsp; At another time,
when the Philistine giant defied the armies of the living God,
David went forth of his own accord to meet him.&nbsp; Mindful of
the same power which had saved him from &ldquo;<i>the lion and
the bear</i>,&rdquo; he asked no armour for his protection.&nbsp;
He sought no weapon for the fight.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Strong in the
Lord</i>, <i>and in the power of his might</i>,&rdquo; he
prevailed, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;<i>with a sling and with a stone</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a>&nbsp; And &ldquo;<i>the weak thing</i>,
<i>and the base thing</i>, <i>and the thing that was
despised</i>,&rdquo; was chosen to confound and to
&ldquo;<i>bring to nought the thing that was mighty</i>, <i>in
order that no flesh should glory in the presence of
God</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a>&nbsp; Then, again, how often had David
been rescued from the personal jealousy of Saul!&nbsp; What
signal success had been granted him against the enemies of
Israel!&nbsp; And how strikingly had even the rebellion of his
own misguided son been overruled to the promotion of his safety
and glory!</p>
<p>But it appears that all this instruction had been given him in
vain.&nbsp; He was still disposed to depend, in the transaction
before us, upon the &ldquo;<i>arm of flesh</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Proud of the extent of his dominions and of the multitude of his
subjects, and secretly pleased with the proof it would afford to
other nations of his own wisdom and good government, he caused
the people to be numbered; although, as the opening of this very
chapter shows, it was against the advice, and even the
entreaties, of his own officers.&nbsp; For &ldquo;<i>Joab</i>,
<i>the captain of the host</i>, <i>had said unto the king</i>,
<i>Now the Lord thy God add unto the people</i>, <i>how many
soever they be</i>, <i>an hundredfold</i>, <i>and that the eyes
of my lord the king may see it</i>: <i>but why doth my lord the
king delight in this thing</i>?&nbsp; <i>Notwithstanding the
king&rsquo;s word prevailed against Joab</i>, <i>and against the
captains of the host</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation4c"></a><a
href="#footnote4c" class="citation">[4c]</a>&nbsp; The heart of
David, however, was soon opened by Divine grace to confess and to
deplore the offence which he had committed.&nbsp; And the fearful
judgment that followed served at once, in the most instructive
manner, to humble and to disappoint him, by showing him how
entirely he was dependent upon God for that <i>very source of
strength and greatness</i> which his conceit led him to prize so
highly, and how suddenly he might be stripped of it.&nbsp; The
account is given in the verses which follow immediately upon the
text.&nbsp; For being allowed to choose between three <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>visitations,
famine, war, and pestilence, and preferring that which he
supposed would fall upon his country most lightly, &ldquo;<i>the
Lord</i>,&rdquo; we read, &ldquo;<i>sent a pestilence upon Israel
from the morning even to the time appointed</i>, <i>and there
died of the people seventy thousand men</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be right for us to bear in mind, that what made this
act of numbering the Israelites so very offensive to God, was
that it tended to draw off the hearts of the king and of his
people from that single and undivided regard which they owed to
Him.&nbsp; All the trials of that nation carried on for such a
long course of years, and all the statutes and laws given for
their guidance, were meant to keep this conviction uppermost in
their minds.&nbsp; They had been singled out from the rest of
mankind, not only as the guardians of the true faith and worship,
but as witnesses to all the world of the power, and love, and
faithfulness of the Lord.&nbsp; Special mercies, continued
miracles, wonderful deliverances were wrought for them, in order
that they might feel, at every stage of their eventful history,
that they were peculiarly <i>His people</i>.&nbsp; If
<i>bread</i> was wanting to allay their hunger, or <i>water</i>
to assuage their thirst, or <i>raiment</i> to cover their bodies,
it was not provided by any of the slow contrivances of human
industry.&nbsp; But <i>the hard rock</i> poured forth
<i>their</i> water, and <i>the heavens</i> showered down
<i>their</i> food, and their &ldquo;<i>raiment waxed not old upon
them</i>,&rdquo; even during the long period of forty
years.&nbsp; If the inhabitants of every other land gave way
before them as they advanced, <i>they</i> were taught, and they
might have learnt, from the utter disproportion of their own
powers, that it was &ldquo;<i>the Lord their God</i>&rdquo; who
drove them out.&nbsp; And if, in the restlessness of their
spirit, they desired to have a king to reign over them, they were
reminded that &ldquo;<i>the Lord their God</i>&rdquo; was
<i>their</i> King.&nbsp; However <i>few</i>, in any case, were
the numbers of <i>their</i> hosts, they always proved
<i>sufficient</i> for the work which they were charged to
achieve.&nbsp; And however <i>numerous</i> they were at <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>other times, it
might yet please Him, as it did on the occasion here recorded, to
turn their strength into weakness in an instant.&nbsp; This
numbering of the people, therefore, showed an utter distrust of
that goodness which had never failed them, and called down a
judgment so severe, that it must have warned them for ever
against a repetition of the offence.</p>
<p>The question will have occurred already, perhaps, to the minds
of some who hear me, Can any similar degree of guilt attach to
that numbering of our own people which is going on at this time
throughout the land, from one end of it even to the other?&nbsp;
If, in the case of David, the measure was condemned so fearfully,
and involved so signal a punishment, what are the circumstances
in our own case that tend to remove from it any such reproach,
and may even lead us to hope that instead of thwarting the will
and pleasure of our God, we are really proceeding in conformity
to it, and even promoting his purposes of grace and goodness to
our land?</p>
<p>My brethren, in order to answer such an inquiry aright, it
seems only necessary that we should remember the essential
difference already pointed out between the chosen nation and any
which the world has since seen.&nbsp; Never in any other case has
the civil government of kingdoms been carried on by the immediate
agency of Almighty power.&nbsp; <i>Our</i> national welfare
depends not upon miracles, but upon those provisions of human
forethought or experience, which, under the Divine blessing,
appear best adapted to meet each exigency that arises.&nbsp; And
although there is often cause to lament that this blessing is so
seldom <i>implored</i> by us distinctly and publicly as a
Christian people, and so little <i>acknowledged</i> by us in the
many mercies, which, as a Christian people, we are enjoying, yet
still we may humbly believe that the inquiry now conducted cannot
be displeasing to God.&nbsp; Many facts will be learnt from it
conducive to the common <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>good, and tending either to suggest or
to mature provisions for our social improvement.&nbsp; Many
practical lessons will be gained, teaching us how we may better
&ldquo;<i>bear each other&rsquo;s burdens</i>, <i>and so fulfil
the law of Christ</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation7a"></a><a
href="#footnote7a" class="citation">[7a]</a>&nbsp; Many truths
will be derived from the results of this Census, which may
strengthen our hands as &ldquo;<i>members one of
another</i>;&rdquo; <a name="citation7b"></a><a
href="#footnote7b" class="citation">[7b]</a> and some objects, it
may be hoped, will be answered by it, in the advancement of which
we may cheerfully join in giving effect to the counsels of our
rulers.</p>
<p>At the same time there are thoughts mingling with this subject
of a more serious and personal kind, to which I could desire, in
the guidance of God&rsquo;s Spirit, to direct your minds.&nbsp;
And the occasion for suggesting them appears so seasonable, and
occurs so seldom, that it may reconcile us to the omission of
other topics of inquiry, and the endeavour to found upon it some
which may be made, under the teaching of that Spirit, conducive
to our edification and salvation.</p>
<p>This enrolling of our people <i>every tenth year</i>, each
man&rsquo;s family in his own house, may it not read to us some
lessons as Christians; while it affords to those who are set over
us in the Lord, the materials for their guidance in the great
work of government and legislation?&nbsp; Whether we regard it as
private individuals, or as fellow-subjects in that civil
community with which the Providence of God has connected us, or
as members of the Church of Christ and &ldquo;<i>heirs together
of the grace of life</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation7c"></a><a
href="#footnote7c" class="citation">[7c]</a> it may suggest to us
many reflections of thankfulness, self-inquiry and abasement.</p>
<p><i>Ten years</i> have passed away since this Census was last
taken; and of course by far the larger portion of those here
present were at that time included in it.&nbsp; These allotted
periods fixed by the institutions of men agree very remarkably
with those which the Spirit of God in his word has pointed out as
warnings <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of
the shortness and the uncertainty of life.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>The
days of our age are threescore years and ten</i>; <i>and if by
reason of strength they be fourscore years</i>, <i>yet is their
strength labour and sorrow</i>; <i>for it is soon cut off</i>,
<i>and we fly away</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; If this, then,
be the limit to the life of man, what an important portion of it
do these latter years contain, quickly as they pass away, and
short as they now appear in looking back upon them!&nbsp; It is
well known that nearly one-half of the number of deaths that
occur among mankind happen before the tenth year of life is
completed.&nbsp; Yet have <i>we all</i> been spared, through
sickness, and casualties, and during one year of that term
through pestilence itself raging at our doors, to see the end of
it; and to improve it, as affording a rich fund of opportunities,
and warnings, and motives, and principles for the period yet to
come.&nbsp; Nor is it only life that has been thus continued to
us; but life with all its attendant health, and strength, and
reason, and many temporal comforts.&nbsp; And there have been
dangers warded off, and blessings multiplied to us in a measure
which we should now find it difficult, even with the utmost
stretch of memory, to reckon; still less to trace out all those
impressions of gratitude and praise towards the Great Dispenser
of them all, which each of them, as it passed, ought to have
fixed indelibly upon the heart.&nbsp; For these are all the
gifts, too often even the unasked gifts, but in every case the
undeserved and ill-requited gifts of Him &ldquo;<i>in whom we
live</i>, <i>and move</i>, <i>and have our being</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a>&nbsp; And in addition to these, how
mercifully have our spiritual privileges been continued to us,
those which unite us with &ldquo;<i>Christ the hope of
glory</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c"
class="citation">[8c]</a> and which open to us the supplies of
His grace, and which long since ought to have led our affections
from earthly to heavenly things.&nbsp; <i>For ten years more</i>
has the revealed word of God been spread out before us,
&ldquo;<i>the engrafted word</i>, <i>which is able to save our
</i><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span><i>souls</i>;&rdquo; <a name="citation9a"></a><a
href="#footnote9a" class="citation">[9a]</a> inviting us to
&ldquo;<i>flee from the wrath to come</i>;&rdquo; <a
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a> charging us to have our treasure in
heaven; and reminding us, wherever we open it, of the things
which belong to our eternal peace.&nbsp; <i>For ten years
more</i> has His Blessed Son been calling to us to &ldquo;<i>come
to Him that we might have life</i>;&rdquo; <a
name="citation9c"></a><a href="#footnote9c"
class="citation">[9c]</a> cheering us with the promise that
&ldquo;<i>whosoever cometh to Him shall in no wise be cast
out</i>;&rdquo; <a name="citation9d"></a><a href="#footnote9d"
class="citation">[9d]</a> offering to meet and to bless us with
His spiritual presence in the ordinances of His own appointment
upon earth, and interceding for us continually before the throne
of His Father in heaven.&nbsp; <i>For ten years more</i> has that
Spirit who does &ldquo;<i>not always strive with man</i>,&rdquo;
<a name="citation9e"></a><a href="#footnote9e"
class="citation">[9e]</a> been striving with <i>us</i>; often
grieved by our coldness, our inconsistency, our unwatchfulness;
yet never quite leaving us to ourselves; and even now waiting to
be entreated by us, that He may purify and sanctify us
wholly.&nbsp; And let me say, that if it is an obvious, it is
also a solemn thought, that <i>these ten years</i> have included
above 500 Sabbaths; each of which might have been, had we
diligently improved them, a new step in our advancement towards
heaven.&nbsp; They might have made such an addition to our stock
of spiritual knowledge, and strength, and progress, as would ere
now have carried us far more onward than we have yet reached
towards that &ldquo;<i>rest which remaineth for the people of
God</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation9f"></a><a href="#footnote9f"
class="citation">[9f]</a></p>
<p>And then comes the concerning question, from which not one
person who hears me can escape; In what manner, to what degree
have these advantages been turned to account?&nbsp; <i>These ten
years</i> of continued forbearance, and longer trial, and
multiplied mercies on the part of our God, do they find us at the
close of them living more closely to Him; more desirous of His
favour; more afraid of His displeasure; and adorning more, in our
life and conversation, the gospel of His own dear Son?&nbsp;
<i>So much </i><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span><i>nearer</i> as we must know ourselves to be to our
latter end, are we in any, and in what measure, better prepared
to meet it?&nbsp; Do our tempers and pursuits prove us to be,
what this new stage of our journey must convince us that we are,
mere &ldquo;<i>strangers and sojourners upon earth</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a> seeking &ldquo;<i>a better
country</i>, <i>that is</i>, <i>an heavenly</i>?&rdquo; <a
name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a>&nbsp; Or rather, are there not some
sins still, as in time past, a shame and a burden to us; some
evil habits or negligences, some ignorances or omissions yet
cleaving to us, and even growing with our growth, and
strengthening with our strength?&nbsp; The world, the flesh, and
the devil, those three enemies of our souls whom we engaged in
our baptism to renounce, have they less power over us than they
once had?&nbsp; And do we find in ourselves more readiness to
pray, more comfort in our private prayers, more delight in our
Sabbaths, more of actual profit from all the means of grace, than
we did before?&nbsp; With such an inquiry as this presented to
him, and quickened by the thought, that as more time is gone
there is so much the less remaining, may not the most advanced
and established among us find room for confession and
self-abasement?&nbsp; And if this indeed be so, if even
&ldquo;<i>the righteous scarcely be saved</i>, <i>where shall the
ungodly and the sinner appear</i>?&rdquo; <a
name="citation10c"></a><a href="#footnote10c"
class="citation">[10c]</a>&nbsp; Where those who &ldquo;<i>make a
mock at sin</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation10d"></a><a
href="#footnote10d" class="citation">[10d]</a> &ldquo;<i>glory in
their shame</i>,&rdquo; and only &ldquo;<i>mind earthly
things</i>?&rdquo; <a name="citation10e"></a><a
href="#footnote10e" class="citation">[10e]</a>&nbsp; What must be
their state in the sight of God, and what their aggravated
danger, who for <i>ten years more</i> have been
&ldquo;<i>crucifying the Son of God afresh</i>&rdquo; <a
name="citation10f"></a><a href="#footnote10f"
class="citation">[10f]</a> by their open unresisted ways of sin,
despising the grace of God, and giving a more free indulgence to
those very lusts against which the true believers have been at
least watching, and contending, and praying?</p>
<p>My brethren, it may seem, no doubt, an alarming reflection,
but it is still a faithful saying, and confirmed by all our
experience, that if <i>ten years more</i> <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>have not
carried us forward in our heavenly course, if they do not find us
growing in grace, in the knowledge of ourselves and in the
knowledge of Christ Jesus, they will too probably find us
confirmed in evil; more estranged from God; more ripe for
judgment; the chains of sin bound faster around us, and all our
habits more difficult of change; nay, even impossible to be
changed, until that Spirit from on high be given us, who can at
any time turn a man from darkness to light, but who, the longer
He is wilfully slighted, is the less willing to be sought.</p>
<p>These are some of the topics, and, as I well know, they are
but a few of them, which a retrospect of this interval might urge
upon us as individuals; and these arise only from a review of our
own position as the survivors of this new period of probation
which the Lord in mercy has permitted us to pass.&nbsp; But I
might well ask you to cast your eyes once more back, (it will be
wise and profitable for us to do so,) in order that we may call
to mind how many persons, some of them dear to us as our own
souls, <i>began</i> this same period with us, who have not lived
like us to witness its <i>close</i>.&nbsp; If the thought
suggests to any of my hearers some recollections of pain, and
sorrow, and separation, may they have the grace given them to
consider that it is the brightest light which casts the deepest
shadows; and that there are trains of thought which can edify
while they sadden us; like the shade of Peter&rsquo;s body,
which, as it passed across the multitudes, gave life and health
to whatever it obscured. <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
<p>The number of interments which have occurred within the last
ten years in the three burial grounds of this parish have
included more than a fifth part of its population.&nbsp; Such is
the sure and rapid way in which, day by day, and year by year,
the sentence passed upon our fallen race is fulfilled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Dust thou art</i>, <i>and unto dust shalt thou
return</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; And some of
these events, if I could now place them in order before <a

been attended with circumstances so full of awakening
instruction, they have proclaimed so distinctly the instability
of all earthly ties, the vanity of all expectations that have not
heaven for their object, and the love of Christ for their
security and their motive, that no louder call could ever be
addressed to those who have been most nearly affected by
them.&nbsp; And as surely and as quickly will the same mortality
proceed during the next decade of the world&rsquo;s
duration.&nbsp; Another like proportion, another fifth, yes, my
brethren, one person in five, of those who are assembled here
to-day, will be swept off from the engrossing cares and the
unsatisfying frivolities of life into the great charnel-house
which must ere long receive us all.&nbsp; How many more such ties
will be loosened before the same interval recurs again!&nbsp;
Those whom we love the best may be taken from us, or we from
them, never more to meet until the resurrection of the last
day.&nbsp; With such perpetual notices before us of the shortness
of our time, and of the momentous nature of that work which it is
given us to do, let us resolve to work while it is day.&nbsp; Let
us neglect no call; let us abuse no warning; let us lose no
opportunity which may assist us in making our &ldquo;<i>calling
and election sure</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation12a"></a><a
href="#footnote12a" class="citation">[12a]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>This I say</i>,&rdquo; declares St. Paul, with a full
conviction of the truth upon his mind, &ldquo;<i>This I say</i>,
<i>that the time is short</i>: <i>it remaineth</i>, <i>that both
they that have wives be as though they had none</i>; <i>and they
that weep</i>, <i>as though they wept not</i>; <i>and they that
rejoice</i>, <i>as though they rejoiced not</i>; <i>and they that
buy</i>, <i>as though they possessed not</i>; <i>and they that
use this world</i>, <i>as not abusing it</i>: <i>for the fashion
of this world passeth away</i>.&rdquo; <a

<p>Suffer me now to advert to some topics of inquiry which such
an occasion as this presents to us, as members of the same civil
community, fellow-citizens of the same favoured land, or even as
inhabitants of <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>the same parish.&nbsp; There are other mercies for us to
review, and there are other grounds of humiliation in the abuse
of them, which we have to cherish beyond those which belong to us
as private individuals.&nbsp; And to these we cannot safely be
indifferent.</p>
<p>Consider the many blessings we have to acknowledge as bestowed
upon our country.&nbsp; During the earliest of these intervals
fixed for numbering the people, of which we have now reached the
sixth, we were engaged in destructive wars, always a source of
the most extensive misery and crime.&nbsp; And ever, as the
period came round for enrolling our living population, there was
an allowance to be made for the losses it had suffered of
multitudes who had passed into the grave before their full time,
in foreign lands, amidst the horrors of the battlefield or the
naval fight, their last hours wanting all the solace of domestic
endearment or spiritual comfort.&nbsp; But we have now been
mercifully spared for nearly forty years from any general or
continued war.&nbsp; <i>Ten years more</i> of almost unbroken
peace, or of peace broken only in the remoter dependencies of the
empire, have passed over us.&nbsp; And very few of our
countrymen, comparatively with other times, have had their lives
cut short by a scourge to which the pride and covetousness of
mankind are always urging them, but which it may be hoped the God
of love and peace, in answer to the prayers of His servants, will
continue still to restrain.&nbsp; It was a feeling of the terrors
of that scourge which drew from David the affecting entreaty
recorded in the chapter before us: &ldquo;<i>Let us fall now into
the hands of the Lord</i>; <i>for his mercies are great</i>:
<i>and let us not fall into the hands of man</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a></p>
<p>And if it cannot equally be said that our land has been spared
from the visitation of pestilence, if it has pleased God, within
the last ten years, to send again among us that fearful judgment,
what cause had we for thankfulness that even in the midst of that
judgment <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>He remembered mercy, and that in the most direct answer
to prevailing prayer that we have ever witnessed, He caused the
disorder to cease even at the time when it seemed to be defying
all human means of restraining it.</p>
<p>There are two aspects in which this new enrolment will present
itself to the mind as connected with our national state.&nbsp;
And there are different conclusions to be drawn from it,
according as they are viewed or not in the light which the
Scripture gives us, and tried by the rules which it
affords.&nbsp; It may be thought, when this new list is making
out of our people from one end of the country to the other,
advancing as they probably are in numbers, intelligence, and
wealth, the result of it will rather speak the language of
exultation than of abasement.&nbsp; While we are arranging in
their different classes our men of opulence, and our men of
business, and our men of science, &ldquo;<i>merchants</i>,&rdquo;
like those of the &ldquo;<i>crowning city</i>,&rdquo; equal to
&ldquo;<i>princes</i>, <i>and traffickers ranked among the
honourable of the earth</i>;&rdquo; <a name="citation14a"></a><a
href="#footnote14a" class="citation">[14a]</a> our cunning
artificers and our tillers of the ground surpassing those of
other lands in diligence, enterprise, and talent; there is enough
here, it may be thought, to assure us that God is well pleased
with us, and that all these proofs of worldly prosperity are
pledges of His favour.&nbsp; Surely, it will be said by some who
witness it, &ldquo;<i>this great nation is a wise and
understanding people</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation14b"></a><a
href="#footnote14b" class="citation">[14b]</a>&nbsp; And yet let
us remember, that the distinctions of nations, like those of
individuals, are given to them as talents to be accounted for and
improved, not in order to flatter pride, or to promote the
comparison of themselves with others.&nbsp; The higher is the
measure of our privileges, the heavier is the weight of our
responsibilities.&nbsp; These signs of greatness may be found
utterly worthless when they are weighed in the balance of the
sanctuary, and may be tending only to increase our
condemnation.&nbsp; If, indeed, our <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>zeal for God&rsquo;s glory had kept
pace with our experience of His mercies; if, placed as we are at
the head of the commerce of the world, our influence reaching to
every sea and every shore on which the sun shines, we had carried
with us that best of our national treasures, that which is
interdicted to some nations, and, alas! as yet unknown to many
more, the pure, the full, the free gospel of the grace of God;
if, many years ago, we had taken up that position, to the
importance of which we seem only to have awakened of late, that
of being, as the heralds of the Church, the evangelizers of
mankind; if the moral and spiritual improvement of our people at
home had advanced as rapidly as their intellectual character,
then, indeed, we might have given up the account of our resources
with joy and not with grief.&nbsp; But since it is most true, as
you yourselves also know, that while the largest funds are never
wanting for every scheme, the wildest, the most uncertain, of
worldly speculation or display, they are often left to fail, and
to fall away, and to be importuned for in the prosecution of the
soberest, the most scriptural plans for promoting the glory of
God, or the welfare of some distressed portion or other of our
fellow-men; if all the boasted improvements in our means of
communication are only carrying into the quietest and least
corrupted districts of the land new incentives to Sabbath
desecration; if while we have been spared from the desolations of
foreign war, we are given up, at this very hour, to intestine
divisions pervading equally the Church and the State, and upon
questions where a Christian people ought to be found essentially
agreed; here, again, we have cause rather to humble than to exalt
ourselves, and to fear lest our God should enter into judgment
with us for this poor requital of all the distinctions with which
we have been blessed.</p>
<p>The most remarkable event which, within <i>the last ten
years</i>, has affected the spiritual state of our own <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>parish, has
been the erection, in a district scarcely built upon before, but
in the midst of a poor and now rapidly increasing population, of
a spacious and splendid Roman Catholic church, with extensive
school-rooms and the residence of a priest attached to it.&nbsp;
My brethren, there are but few probably among us who would lament
this measure, if its only design and its only effect were to
provide for the instruction of that large number of Roman
Catholic labourers who inhabit that and the contiguous
districts.&nbsp; Shut out as they are, by the stern prohibitions
of their own priesthood, from all access to our means of grace;
taught to believe that all doctrine is heresy, and all
instruction hurtful, which does not flow directly from their own
communion; living among us, as they did, for so many years, like
sheep having no shepherd, who would condemn the only provision
being at length made for them, of which their unhappy state
admitted?&nbsp; Nay more; may we not hope that having been left
hitherto equally ignorant and fettered, ignorant of the commonest
means of knowledge, and fettered and precluded from attaining it,
the instruction now given to their children will one day become
the blessed means of enabling them to throw off their fetters,
and make an opening for the light of Gospel truth to shine upon
their souls?&nbsp; But, alas! all that we see and hear forbids us
to believe that the only design or effect of this measure is to
enable the Romanists to provide for their own people.&nbsp; There
is already too much evidence to show that it has all the
character of an aggression upon the faith of the members of our
Church.&nbsp; It is in full accordance with those measures, which
within the last few months have happily awakened the Protestant
spirit of our whole people, and have shown in its true colours
the influence of that unscriptural and grasping Church from which
they sprang.&nbsp; By devices the most insidious, our people are
invited to witness the imposing ritual of this new building; <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>while
depositaries are opened, even at our own doors, for the public
sale of cheap tracts, that tend, with bitter irony and gross
misstatements, to discredit <i>our</i> institutions and to
recommend <i>theirs</i>. <a name="citation17a"></a><a
href="#footnote17a" class="citation">[17a]</a>&nbsp; What will be
the actual result of all this conflict between truth and error
before <i>ten more years</i> have passed, it may not be easy to
say.&nbsp; If those among us who are spared to outlive them are
enabled to &ldquo;<i>hold fast the profession of their faith
without wavering</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation17b"></a><a
href="#footnote17b" class="citation">[17b]</a> they may not only
save their own souls, but lead others, who can only view Him now
through the mists of their corruptions, to honour the holy name
of Him by whom we are called.&nbsp; But surely, with these facts
before us, there is the strongest inducement for us all, not only
to examine ourselves whether we are in the faith, but why, and on
what grounds we are in it; <a name="citation17c"></a><a
href="#footnote17c" class="citation">[17c]</a> while there is a
motive created strong enough to induce all who have the means at
their command to promote any well-advised plans for arresting the
evil, or turning it, through God&rsquo;s blessing, to good. <a
name="citation17d"></a><a href="#footnote17d"
class="citation">[17d]</a></p>
<p>To conclude.&nbsp; The inquiry which will be going on
to-morrow throughout the country is addressed to us all, as the
heads of our separate households; each giving a return of the
names, and ages, and birthplace, and occupations of those, who
will pass this very night under his own roof.&nbsp; But surely
the thought will occur to <i>some</i> among us, I would to God
that it might be brought home by His Spirit to the hearts of
<i>all</i>, that there are several other points of inquiry
besides these, upon which the great Head of the Church may be
expecting, and really does expect, an account to be rendered by
us.&nbsp; We may have no power to influence the character or to
regulate the habits of those large masses of the people whose
irreligion, in the crowded districts that surround us, we may
deplore.&nbsp; The influence which is to affect a whole nation
falls within the power of very few.&nbsp; But that which affects
the character of any family or household, <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>(and nations
are made up of families) depends mainly on the principles, aye,
and even on the tempers and way of life of those whom God places
over them; for this also is an allotment of His providence.&nbsp;
Let us then suppose for an instant, that it was desired to
obtain, as on this same day, a return of what might be called the
spiritual statistics of England.&nbsp; Suppose, that laying
aside, or rather looking beyond the mere considerations of civil
or political economy, it were wished to learn by such distinct
and palpable records as might be furnished, the actual state of
religion through the whole extent of our population.&nbsp; I well
know, indeed, that there are signs and marks of which no earthly
inquiries could take cognizance; proofs of spiritual growth in
some, and of declension in others; secret concessions to the
corrupt nature in one class, or inward aspirations after holiness
in the other; hypocrisies which no eye can detect among
&ldquo;<i>the children of this world</i>,&rdquo; and spiritual
conflicts in the &ldquo;<i>children of light</i>,&rdquo; which
can only be known to the Supreme Searcher of their hearts.&nbsp;
But when all this is allowed, we might lay down some distinctions
in every case, the existence or the absence of which would go far
to show, whether the master of that house, and those around him,
were really serving God or not.&nbsp; If it were inquired
throughout the land, or if, limiting the supposition to our own
parish, it were asked in every house, Is family prayer maintained
<i>under this roof</i>? <a name="citation18a"></a><a
href="#footnote18a" class="citation">[18a]</a>&nbsp; Is the
Sabbath observed by the master, by the servants, by the children,
as &ldquo;<i>a delight</i>, <i>the holy of the Lord</i>,
<i>honourable</i>?&rdquo; <a name="citation18b"></a><a
href="#footnote18b" class="citation">[18b]</a> all work suspended
which may be left undone, and every pursuit given up which is
inconsistent with the real spirit of the day, as one of holy
rest?&nbsp; Would the general answers to these questions be such
as we could really ponder over with any comfort?&nbsp; Or again,
if it were asked, How many Bibles <i>in this house</i> are
diligently searched?&nbsp; How <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>many of its inmates are not only
permitted, but encouraged and invited, and if need be, urged to
attend upon the public worship of God?&nbsp; Is there a
servants&rsquo; library <i>in this house</i>, to which every one
of them may have recourse for some edifying or self-improving
reading during the leisure intervals of their service? <a
name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a"
class="citation">[19a]</a>&nbsp; How many communicants are there
<i>in this family</i> among those who have reached the proper age
of full communion with the Church, and with her living
Head?&nbsp; How many of the children are really reared in the
spirit of their baptismal vows, &ldquo;<i>virtuously brought up
to lead a godly and a Christian life</i>?&rdquo; <a
name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a>&nbsp; Are not these subjects of
inquiry on which there would be too great cause for self-reproach
to many among us; the reproach resting upon those who had all the
means afforded them for their spiritual sustenance and growth,
but have carelessly neglected to improve them?</p>
<p>My brethren, I commend these remarks in all faithfulness and
affection to your private meditations and your prayers.&nbsp; And
may your own consciences, enlightened by the Spirit of God, guide
you to some profitable application of them!&nbsp; May it be given
to each of us to feel this day, that we are supplying a return of
so many beings, not merely connected with us by the ties and
duties of an earthly relation, or a short-lived existence here;
but of those who are travelling on quickly with ourselves to an
eternity of bliss or woe; precious, never-dying souls; the
objects equally with us of the Saviour&rsquo;s love, the
Spirit&rsquo;s teaching, and the Father&rsquo;s care; called
equally with us to be members of Christ, children of God, and
heirs of the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; What &ldquo;<i>I say unto
you I would say unto all</i>, <i>Watch</i>! <i>for ye know not
when the Master of the house will come</i>&rdquo; to reckon with
us, whether at the close, or the middle, or the opening of this
new decade on which we are now entering.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>But
this we know, that when the Lord does come the second time from
heaven, then will be the great numbering of the nations: not the
mere periodical census of a single kingdom, which, with all its
boasted wealth and enterprise, is but a mere speck upon the
surface of our earth; but a numbering of all the myriads that
have ever peopled it, from the family of the first man until
there &ldquo;<i>shall be time no longer</i>;&rdquo; <a
name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a> &ldquo;<i>the sea giving up the dead
which are in it</i>; <i>and death and the grave delivering up the
dead</i>&rdquo; <a name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a> which are in them; and all
distinctions of age, or rank, or learning, or riches, or power,
lost and sunk, in the simple but everlasting distinction between
those who served God, and those who served Him not; those whose
names are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life, and those not
to be found there.&nbsp; And then will these inquiries and such
as these, which your ministers urge upon you now in &ldquo;<i>the
foolishness of preaching</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation20c"></a><a
href="#footnote20c" class="citation">[20c]</a> but which too
often reach only unwilling ears and careless hearts, then shall
they be enforced by &ldquo;<i>the voice of the archangel and by
the trump of God</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation20d"></a><a
href="#footnote20d" class="citation">[20d]</a></p>
<p>Let us then &ldquo;<i>walk circumspectly</i>, <i>not as
fools</i>, <i>but as wise</i>, <i>redeeming the time</i>,
<i>because the days are evil</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation20e"></a><a href="#footnote20e"
class="citation">[20e]</a>&nbsp; And may we be found so far
faithful to Him who calls us, that out of these our earthly
households, some may be continually gathering to join that
&ldquo;<i>multitude which no man can number</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation20f"></a><a href="#footnote20f"
class="citation">[20f]</a> who, on the sea of glass and before
the sapphire throne, are worshipping Him that sits upon the
throne, and casting their crowns before Him, and saying,
&ldquo;<i>Thou art worthy to receive glory</i>, <i>and

21</span>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>Note A. (P. 17.)</h3>
<p>During the evenings of the late winter months a series of
scenic representations, twice in every week, was displayed in the
school-room, which is near the church; and the admission being
free, they were attended by large numbers of the poorer class,
Roman Catholic and Protestant.&nbsp; On these occasions the
priest always attended, and explained the subjects represented,
which were uniformly taken from the Scripture.&nbsp; And he lost
no opportunity of inviting his audience to hear the same subjects
enforced in the church which thus interested them in the
school-room.</p>
<p>The following extracts from some of these tracts, which are
all announced upon a large printed placard in the window of the
house where they are sold, as having received</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The</span>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">approbation of his Eminence Cardinal
Wiseman and all the Catholic Bishops</span>,&rdquo;</p>
<p>will justify, it is presumed, without a comment, the epithets
here applied to them, as describing their character and
tendency.&nbsp; They are either untrue, unfair, or ironical.</p>
<p>Extracts from a tract, entitled, &ldquo;<i>Protestantism
weighed in its own Balance</i>, <i>and found wanting</i>.&nbsp;
No. 1.&nbsp; <i>The Bible</i>, <i>and the Bible
only</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is worth observing that this rule of
faith, as well in its short and popular form, as also when more
fully drawn out and explained, is rather negative than
positive.&nbsp; Those who use it are more careful to say what
they do <i>not</i> than what they <i>do</i>.&nbsp; They insist
upon &lsquo;the Bible <i>only</i>&rsquo; to the exclusion of
everything else, but they are not equally jealous about receiving
the whole Bible, every part of it.&nbsp; They say that nothing is
to be required of any man that it <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>should be believed which is not to be
found in the Bible, or at least may not be proved thereby; but
they do not with equal distinctness insist upon the duty of
believing everything which <i>is</i> read in that sacred book or
<i>may be</i> proved by it.&nbsp; This is no idle assertion, but
is plain matter of fact.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many texts even then which they do not really
receive; some which are to them as an unknown tongue, without any
meaning at all, and which they therefore make no use of whatever;
others which seem to be opposed to their own creed, and which
they therefore try to escape from and to explain away; lastly,
there are others which they even boldly
contradict.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If God did not intend the Bible to be man&rsquo;s only
guide and teacher in matters of religion, but appointed His
Church for this very purpose, that she should fulfil this office,
and promised her His guidance, so that she should never be
deceived in proposing anything to our belief that was not true
and had not been revealed by Him, then of course, not only is the
Catholic Church right upon this point, but also of necessity
right upon every other point also.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 6.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Protestant professes that the only sure way of
knowing God&rsquo;s will is for every man to read the Holy
Scriptures for himself.&nbsp; I take up the Holy Scriptures,
therefore, for this purpose, and I find there that our Lord
appointed, and the apostles practised, quite another way of
learning God&rsquo;s will and the right road to heaven.&nbsp; I
find that our Lord sent, not a message, but messengers; not a
book for men to read, but apostles for men to obey; and in like
manner I find that the apostles do say not a word about the
necessity of not believing anything that is not written in a
certain book, but on the contrary, that they distinctly say,
Believe all that you have been taught, whether written or
unwritten.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is plain that our Lord did not use the words,
&lsquo;Search the Scriptures,&rsquo; in the sense in which the
Protestants use them.&nbsp; He did not refer His hearers to the
Scriptures in the same way that the Protestant refers you.&nbsp;
For if so, why did they need His further teaching?&nbsp; He made
the same use of the Scriptures as Catholics do in speaking to
Protestants at this day.&nbsp; The Catholic says to Protestants,
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&lsquo;Search the Scriptures,&rsquo; for these are they
which testify of the Church as well as of her Head.&nbsp; They
expressly command you to &lsquo;hear the Church&rsquo; (St. Matt,
xviii. 17).&rdquo;&mdash;P. 11.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Catholic priest at the present day might follow the
example of St. Paul, and show that Jesus whom he preached was
Christ; that the Church which he preached to them was in very
deed the society to which such high and noble privileges were
promised in Holy Scripture.&nbsp; And every one who should give
heed to his preaching in the same way as the Bereans did, would
not fail to meet with the same reward.&nbsp; He also would
&lsquo;believe;&rsquo; believe not only the one doctrine which
had been thus proved to him from Holy Scripture, viz. that the
Church was the appointed teacher of mankind, but also every other
doctrine which the same teacher might propose to his belief,
whether written in the Holy Bible or not.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extract from another tract, entitled, &ldquo;<i>The
Church</i>, <i>the Guardian of Scripture</i>, or, <i>How does the
Bible come to us</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;People are apt to think of the Bible, as if
it were a whole without parts, indivisible, self-existent, in
short, a kind of divinity; or, at least, as if it had come down
from heaven precisely such as we now have it, ready bound to our
hands, if not with the Bible Society&rsquo;s stamp upon
it.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extract from another tract, entitled, &ldquo;<i>The Rosary of
the Blessed Virgin Mary</i>, or, <i>The use of the Beads no vain
Repetition</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Perhaps you find something that shocks you
in the fact of the &lsquo;Hail Mary&rsquo; being repeated so much
oftener than the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer; and it may be that there is
in this a fresh instance of that unhappy creature-worship which
disfigures every part of the Catholic religion.&nbsp; Now do not
suppose that the reason of this is, that we consider prayers
addressed to the Blessed Virgin better than prayers addressed to
God.&nbsp; We do certainly think her prayers for us are better,
and more likely to be heard and answered than our own; because we
know that she was ever perfectly free from all stain of guilt,
and is now nearest to God in glory; and we feel ourselves full of
the defilement of sin.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 10.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;Christ has entered into His kingdom, and His
saints are reigning with Him.&nbsp; Which of them shall be
nearest to Him in glory as once in suffering, but her through
whom He joined our human nature to Deity itself?&nbsp; The
anguish over, the grace and virtue crowned, the glory never to
pass away; surely, well may we again call the Queen of Heaven,
&lsquo;Blessed among women!&rsquo; and more than ever trusting in
the power of her intercession, more than ever call on her,
&lsquo;Holy Mary, mother of God! pray for us sinners, now, and at
the hour of death.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;P. 14.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SECOND AND FOURTH OF THE FIVE
SORROWFUL MYSTERIES.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2d.&nbsp; The scourging of our Blessed Lord, at the
pillar by soldiers, in Pilate&rsquo;s house; the number of
stripes they gave him being above five thousand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4th.&nbsp; The carrying of the Cross; in which our Lord
Jesus Christ, being sentenced to die, bears with most amazing
patience the cross which is laid upon Him for His greater torment
and ignominy, meeting His blessed mother by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">FOURTH AND FIFTH OF THE FIVE
GLORIOUS MYSTERIES.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4th.&nbsp; The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin; in
which after her death, twelve years after the Resurrection, she
is assumed into heaven by her Divine Son accompanied by the holy
angels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5th.&nbsp; The Coronation of the Blessed Virgin; in
which, amid the great jubilee and exultation of the whole court
of heaven, and to the particular glory of all the saints, she is
crowned by her Son with the brightest diadem of
glory.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 16.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extracts from a tract, entitled, &ldquo;<i>Our Parish Churches
as they were and as they are</i>.&nbsp; 1. <i>Old stones tell
tales</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I declare, it seems to me that the very
idea of worship has almost died out in England.&nbsp; Do you
think that if people really felt they were speaking to Almighty
God, they would sit at their ease, or look over a book, and never
do more?&nbsp; Church of Englandism has such a <i>comfortable</i>
look about it; it is the religion of people well to do in the
world, and have too much business to transact to turn their minds
thoroughly to anything else.&nbsp; It is a <i>one day a week</i>
religion.&nbsp; Every thing about it is so formal, so decent, <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>so sober, so
proper and respectable.&nbsp; It would look so odd to seem in
earnest; to be on your knees in prayer before so many
well-dressed people, as though you had a soul to be saved.&nbsp;
Church of Englandism is such a human thing; it smacks so much of
the world and of &lsquo;good society.&rsquo;&nbsp; It makes a
poor man feel awkward, just as he does when he finds himself in a
gentleman&rsquo;s drawing-room.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church of England would never have built such
churches, though it is very proud of them now it has got them,
and lately has taken to making a few others in imitation of the
old ones.&nbsp; People never seem to think of this.&nbsp; They
are always bragging about their fine old parish churches, and
their venerable cathedrals, and all the while they were built by
the Papists, as they call them; and if it had not been for the
Papists they would never have had them to brag of.&nbsp; The
sparrow stole into the martin&rsquo;s nest, and said, See what a
nice warm house I have got.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t say he had
<i>made</i> it, but he was quite as cocky as if he
had.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 11.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what is this?&rsquo; said I again; and I
pointed at a curious sort of niche with a hole at the bottom of
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;That,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is a
<i>piscina</i>; it was for pouring the water away after the
priest had washed his hands.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why should he
wash his hands,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;more than our
ministers?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said Peter,
&lsquo;he had to touch the body of the Lord, and to lift Him up,
as when He was raised on the cross.&nbsp; And your ministers have
no need to wash theirs, because they have not got the body of our
Lord there at all.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;p. 14.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What was the use of saying mass for him,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;when he was dead and buried?&rsquo;&nbsp; Peter
smiled, and answered, &lsquo;It is said in the Scriptures, that
it is a good and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, and it
certainly must be so.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;P. 15.</p>

<p>Extracts from a tract, entitled, &ldquo;<i>The Church of our
Fathers</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;St. Peter, the prince of the apostles, to
whom our Lord himself gave the name of Peter, which signifies a
rock, and told him at the same time that on that rock He would
build His Church, and that the gates of hell should not prevail
against it,&mdash;this same Peter went to Rome and <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>became its
Bishop; and from that time the Church of Rome, as being the See
of St. Peter, has ever been looked upon by the faithful as the
mother and mistress of all churches, and each of his successors
in turn as the visible head of the Church on
earth.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 5.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is generally believed that Caractacus settled in
Rome with his family; that his daughter was called Claudia, and
that she married a noble Roman called Pudens, who, together with
herself, afterwards became Christian; that they had a daughter
who was afterwards celebrated as a saint under the name of St.
Pudentiana; and that this Pudens and Claudia, whom St. Paul
mentions in his Epistle to Timothy (2 Tim. iv. 21), were no other
than these.&nbsp; It is said also that this noble British
household gave shelter and hospitality to St. Peter, while he
lived as Bishop in Rome; a retired room in the house being set
apart as his chapel.&nbsp; A church was afterwards built on the
site of this house, which having been since twice rebuilt, is
still known by the name of St. Pudentiana; and it is this church
which, from its connexion with the history of our country, has
been assigned to Cardinal Wiseman as the church from which he
takes his title.&rdquo;&mdash;P. 7.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several miracles attended the death of this our first
martyr (Alban).&nbsp; When on his way to death, he came to a
river which divided the town from the hill where he was to
suffer; the people thronged the bridge over it in such multitudes
that he feared he should not be able to pass all that day, and
longing for his crown, raised his eyes to heaven and
prayed.&nbsp; And God straightway divided the waters as for His
people of old, so that he walked through dryshod.&rdquo;&mdash;P.
9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next thing that we hear of the Church in Britain
is, that two bishops from Gaul, Germanus and Lupus, were sent
over here to preach to the people, many of whom had been
perverted by false teachers; but all gladly listened to the
preaching of these holy bishops, and returned to the way of
truth.&nbsp; They were the more easily persuaded, because the
preaching of these men was also accompanied by the working of
miracles.&nbsp; After a public conference, in which the heretics
had been completely put to silence by the eloquence of the
bishops, an officer in the Roman army stepped forward with his
little daughter who was blind, <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>and begged that they would bestow
such relief upon her as they were able.&nbsp; The bishops desired
him to try first the powers of those false teachers who had been
just now disputing against them.&nbsp; But these declined the
trial, and united with the officer in begging her cure at the
hands of Germanus and Lupus.&nbsp; Upon this Germanus offered up
a short prayer, and invoking the Holy Trinity, pulled from his
bosom a little box of relics which he always carried about
him.&nbsp; This he applied to the girl&rsquo;s eyes, and her
sight was immediately restored.&rdquo;&mdash;Pp. 9, 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extracts from a tract, entitled, &ldquo;<i>How Antichrist
keeps Christmas</i>; or, <i>A Peep at Christmas in a Catholic
country</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is true, indeed, that Christmas is a
festival of such universal gladness, as to thaw for a moment even
the icy heart of Protestantism; sending a ray of joyousness down
into the cold depths of the population of this country, where all
is so smooth and smiling on the surface, all so chill and joyless
underneath.&nbsp; At Christmas I really believe a thrill of
gladness darts through the heart of the great majority of the
people.&nbsp; Churches and chapels are made gay with shining
leaves and scarlet berries; carols are sung in the streets; the
words, &lsquo;A merry Christmas to you!&rsquo; pass from mouth to
mouth; and beef and pudding, the outward form which joy is wont
to put on in this cold, hungry climate, smoke on many a board to
which, alas! for every other day in the year they are utter
strangers.&nbsp; Nay, it is to be hoped that even in union
workhouses there is an intermission of gruel for Christmas
day.&rdquo;&mdash;Pp. 4, 5.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abundant food is a necessity of our climate, and a
condition of our physical well-being to a degree that the people
of the South cannot understand.&nbsp; We are told of our Saxon
forefathers, whom I have before mentioned, that their frames,
though so tall and well-formed, were neither so patient of labour
nor of hunger as might be expected from their apparent
strength.&nbsp; Alas! for the necessity which grinds down our
poor to the endurance of both to such a hurtful degree.&nbsp; But
to return to Christmas.&nbsp; The difference between Catholic and
Protestant Christmas is this, that both love Christmas, but
Catholics love it far more distinctly and consciously for
Christ&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; The very <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>name of the festival is theirs,
Christ&rsquo;s Mass; to Protestants one part of the word has
confessedly lost its meaning, and the other is a dim
vision.&nbsp; Look at the professedly religious part of the
observance of this feast, and see what it amounts to.&nbsp; In
the churches of the English establishment, except the holly
boughs, what is there to tell of the Lord&rsquo;s birth?&nbsp; Of
course the lesson from Scripture recounting that event is read;
so also are certain Psalms which prophetically relate to it; and
a sermon on the Nativity is (sometimes) preached.&nbsp; But
otherwise the ordinary routine of the service goes on the same as
usual.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dearly beloved brethren,&rsquo; holds on the
even tenour of its way, with dulness scarcely mitigated; and
there is really nothing either peculiarly to draw out the
devotion of those assisting at it towards their infant Lord, nor,
which is more to our present purpose, any special outpouring of
such devotion on the part of the Church herself.&rdquo;&mdash;P.

C. (P. 17.)</h3>
<p>It is confidently believed by those persons who are most
familiarly acquainted with the state of the property adjacent to
the new Romish Church, that within a very few years nearly the
whole of it will be covered with new buildings.&nbsp; And it is
so far removed from the churches and National schools at Fulham
and Walham Green, where the population has also increased of late
very considerably, that it is easy to foresee the necessity which
will arise for some new provision for the spiritual instruction
of such a district, growing up nearly in the centre of the parish
of Fulham.&nbsp; In such cases, all experience teaches that it is
far wiser to anticipate the measures that may be required for
meeting the exigency, than to adopt them after it has
occurred.&nbsp; And the Vicar, therefore, deems the present a
suitable opportunity for making it known, that the promise has
been secured of a most eligible piece of land, near the locality
here described, and containing rather more than the third of an
acre, which would be well calculated, either now or hereafter,
for the erection of school-rooms, or a church adapted to the
wants of this growing population.&nbsp; The owner of the land,
knowing the important object for which it has been wished to
obtain it, has liberally consented to accept a price considerably
below that which its marketable value would command, and the
Bishop of London has kindly given his sanction to the
measure.&nbsp; To those persons whose interest in the spiritual
edification of their poorer neighbours may induce them to promote
it, the Vicar will be thankful to afford any information that may
be wished, in reference to this object, and to receive from them
any amount of pecuniary assistance that will be needed to meet
the expense, which of course must be considerable.</p>
<h3>Note D. (P. 18.)</h3>
<p>To those members of the congregation at All Saints, who have
not yet introduced into their families the practice of domestic
prayer, and who may possibly feel the want of some suggestions as
to the books best adapted for conducting it, the Vicar would
desire to recommend one or <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>other of the following publications,
according as they may find them most eligible for their own
use.&nbsp; The different prices named would bring the books
within the means of every class of his people; and he ventures to
urge the adoption of the practice equally upon all.</p>

<h3>Note E. (P. 19.)</h3>
<p>At a time when books of the most valuable and interesting
character are published at prices far below any former precedent,
it seems to be little less than the duty of every master of a
Christian household to furnish to his servants a collection,
however limited, of such works as would be at once most useful
and acceptable to them, which a few shillings annually would
serve to keep up or to extend.&nbsp; The Vicar would wish to
recommend <i>The Churchman&rsquo;s Monthly Magazine</i> as one
publication, which might, in any case, be added with advantage to
such a library.&nbsp; It has now extended to five small volumes,
and is continued periodically.</p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/6/4/8/7/64879


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
